This here Conkey Chickweed , miss , kept a public-house over Battlebridge way , and he had a cellar , where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting , and badger-drawing , and that ; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in , for I 've seen 'em off ` en . He war n't one of the family , at that time ; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag , that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night , by a tall man with a black patch over his eye , who had concealed himself under the bed , and after committing the robbery , jumped slap out of window : which was only a story high . He was wery quick about it . But Conkey was quick , too ; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him , and roused the neighbourhood . They set up a hue-and-cry , directly , and when they came to look about 'em , found that Conkey had hit the robber ; for there was traces of blood , all the way to some palings a good distance off ; and there they lost 'em . However , he had made off with the blunt ; and , consequently , the name of Mr. Chickweed , licensed witler , appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts ; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions , and I do n't know what all , was got up for the poor man , who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss , and went up and down the streets , for three or four days , a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself . One day he came up to the office , all in a hurry , and had a private interview with the magistrate , who , after a deal of talk , rings the bell , and orders Jem Spyers in -LRB- Jem was a active officer -RRB- , and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house . `` I see him , Spyers , '' said Chickweed , `` pass my house yesterday morning , '' `` Why did n't you up , and collar him ! '' says Spyers . `` I was so struck all of a heap , that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick , '' says the poor man ; `` but we 're sure to have him ; for between ten and eleven o'clock at night he passed again . '' Spyers no sooner heard this , than he put some clean linen and a comb , in his pocket , in case he should have to stop a day or two ; and away he goes , and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain , with his hat on , all ready to bolt out , at a moment 's notice . He was smoking his pipe here , late at night , when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out , `` Here he is ! Stop thief ! Murder ! '' Jem Spyers dashes out ; and there he sees Chickweed , a-tearing down the street full cry . Away goes Spyers ; on goes Chickweed ; round turns the people ; everybody roars out , `` Thieves ! '' and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting , all the time , like mad . Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner ; shoots round ; sees a little crowd ; dives in ; `` Which is the man ? '' `` D -- me ! '' says Chickweed , `` I 've lost him again ! '' It was a remarkable occurrence , but he war n't to be seen nowhere , so they went back to the public-house . Next morning , Spyers took his old place , and looked out , from behind the curtain , for a tall man with a black patch over his eye , till his own two eyes ached again . At last , he could n't help shutting 'em , to ease 'em a minute ; and the very moment he did so , he hears Chickweed a-roaring out , `` Here he is ! '' Off he starts once more , with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him ; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday 's one , the man 's lost again ! This was done , once or twice more , till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil , who was playing tricks with him arterwards ; and the other half , that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief .

If it were a girl , it was to inherit the money unconditionally ; but if a boy , only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour , meanness , cowardice , or wrong . He did this , he said , to mark his confidence in the other , and his conviction -- only strengthened by approaching death -- that the child would share her gentle heart , and noble nature . If he were disappointed in this expectation , then the money was to come to you : for then , and not till then , when both children were equal , would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse , who had none upon his heart , but had , from an infant , repulsed him with coldness and aversion .
